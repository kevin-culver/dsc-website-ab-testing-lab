    "In this lab, you continued to get more practice designing and conducting AB tests. This required additional work preprocessing and formulating the initial problem in a suitable manner. Additionally, you also saw how to verify results, strengthening your knowledge of binomial variables, and reviewing initial statistical concepts of the central limit theorem, standard deviation, z-scores, and their accompanying p-values."
